# notes-application
I have built this application as a part of my Node.js course in Udemy. I was exposed to the following things while the developing application:
1) Node Package Manager (npm) and the available node modules
2) Command line parser available in Node.js: yargs
3) Basic Node.js functionalities along with file system tweaking.

About the application: This is a basic note application through which user will be able to do the following things:
a) Add a note: Note can be added to the note list by typing in the 'add' command from the terminal with the required --title and --body options of the note. --title is a string type denoting the note's title and --body denoting the note's body.

b) Remove a note: User can remove a note from the note list by typing in the 'remove' command with the option --title. --title refer to the title of the note's to be deleted.

c) Read a note: A note from the list can be read using the command 'read' with the --title option. --title refer to the title of the note to be read.

d) List notes: User can list the notes available in the note list by typing in the 'list' command.

Finally, the node modules used in the application are available package-lock.json file.
